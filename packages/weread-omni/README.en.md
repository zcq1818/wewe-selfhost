# weread-omni

[简体中文](README.md) | English

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) | [Security policy](SECURITY.md) | [API Endpoints](docs/endpoints.md)

weread-omni is a full-coverage agent skill and unofficial SDK for WeRead. Sign in by QR code and you get 40 read-and-write operations, far beyond the 6 read-only capabilities the official Skill provides.

Those 40 operations have one implementation behind three entry points: the `weread-omni` CLI, where every command can emit JSON; a fully typed TypeScript SDK; and the agent skill bundled in this repo.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Tencent or WeRead.

## Compared to the official Skill

WeRead published an official Agent Skill in May 2026. Accessed with an API key, it covers six capabilities: shelf, book search, reading statistics, book details, notes and highlights, and recommendations. weread-omni covers all of those and adds the following.

| | Official Skill | weread-omni |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Shelf, search, stats, book details, notes and highlights, recommendations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create, edit, and delete your own highlights and reviews | ❌ | ✅ |
| Import EPUB, PDF, MOBI, TXT, AZW3 | ❌ | ✅ |
| Public accounts and articles | ❌ | ✅ |
| WeRead AI | ❌ | ✅ |

## Quickstart

You need Node.js `>=22.13.0` and a WeChat account with working WeRead access.

```bash
npm install --global weread-omni
weread-omni login --json
weread-omni doctor --json
weread-omni search books "The Three-Body Problem" --json
```

The command is `weread-omni`. `0.1.0` installed it as `weread`, which collides with the official Skill's command, so it was renamed in `0.1.1`. Upgrading does not remove the old `weread` binary — reinstall if you had `0.1.0`.

`weread-omni login` presents a single E-Ink QR code — scan it once with your WeRead account.

QR codes and progress go to stderr. On success, the JSON written to stdout contains only the account alias, client ID, `vid`, and device ID—never tokens. `weread-omni doctor` checks the active installation, authentication, and one read-only request.

### Accounts and credentials

The first login without `--account` creates the `default` account. Name additional accounts explicitly:

```bash
weread-omni --account work login --json
weread-omni accounts --json
weread-omni accounts use work --json
weread-omni --account default shelf sync --json
```

An alias must start with a lowercase letter or digit. The remaining characters may be lowercase letters, digits, `-`, or `_`, for a maximum length of 64. If a command omits `--account`, the only configured account is selected automatically. With multiple accounts, `WEREAD_ACCOUNT` takes precedence over the default saved by `weread-omni accounts use <alias>`. If neither selects an account, an interactive terminal lists every account and lets you choose by number or alias; non-interactive commands must pass `--account` or set a default.

Credentials live under `~/.config/weread/accounts/<alias>/` by default. Directories use mode `0700`, and files use `0600`. Set `WEREAD_CONFIG_DIR` to move the configuration root. Every `WEREAD_*` variable read by the project is documented in [`.env.example`](https://github.com/teng-lin/weread-omni/blob/v0.1.2/.env.example).

### Install the agent skill

The bundled `weread` skill teaches an agent to check authentication, call the JSON CLI, follow the correct pagination cursor, and ask before writing. It does not install the `weread-omni` command, so complete the Quickstart first.

Install it with the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash
npx skills add teng-lin/weread-omni --skill weread
```

To install globally for Codex and Claude Code without prompts:

```bash
npx skills add teng-lin/weread-omni --skill weread --global --agent codex --agent claude-code --yes
```

Inspect or update a project installation with:

```bash
npx skills list
npx skills update weread
```

Add `--global` to those two commands for a global installation.

## Closing writes

Writes are enabled by default. Set `WEREAD_READONLY` to `1`, `true`, or `yes` to close every one of them; reads are never affected.

| Variable | Operations governed | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WEREAD_READONLY` | `shelf.add`, `shelf.delete`, `shelf.pin`, `shelf.setPrivate`, `shelf.markFinished`, `shelf.markReading`, `publicAccounts.subscribe`, `publicAccounts.unsubscribe`, `review.add`, `review.edit`, `review.delete`, `notes.addBookmark`, `notes.updateBookmark`, `notes.removeBookmark`, `import.book` | writes open |

Unset, empty, and whitespace-only values leave writes open, and so does any unrecognized value — the switch only ever closes them. It is read once at process startup. In JSON or non-interactive mode, `shelf delete`, `public-accounts unsubscribe`, `notes remove-bookmark`, and `review delete` also require `--yes`.

## Common commands

Every command supports `--json`. Agents should always request JSON output. Run `weread-omni <command> --help` for the authoritative options.

### Search and read

```bash
weread-omni search books "The Three-Body Problem" --json
weread-omni book info BOOK_ID --json
weread-omni book chapters BOOK_ID --json
weread-omni notes bookmarks BOOK_ID --json
weread-omni read-data detail --mode annually --json
weread-omni discover similar BOOK_ID --json
weread-omni ai ask-book BOOK_ID "What is this book's central argument?" --json
```

`book chapters` returns the `chapterUid` used by later commands.

### Shelf, highlights, and reviews

```bash
weread-omni shelf sync --count 50 --json
weread-omni shelf add BOOK_ID --json
weread-omni shelf mark-reading BOOK_ID --json

weread-omni notes add-bookmark BOOK_ID CHAPTER_UID "1-20" "text to highlight" --json
weread-omni review add BOOK_ID "My thoughts after reading" --star 80 --json
```

`shelf pin`, `set-private`, `mark-finished`, and `mark-reading` perform the positive action by default. Use `--no-top`, `--no-secret`, `--no-finished`, or `--no-reading` to reverse it. Review ratings must be one of `20`, `40`, `60`, `80`, or `100`.

### Read one public-account article

Read a WeChat article URL without subscribing to its public account:

```bash
weread-omni public-accounts read-article 'https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ARTICLE' --json
```

Returns title, account name, Markdown, body HTML, source URL and timestamps.
`fromCache` identifies a stored copy; cache hits return `cachedAt` and a null
`fetchedAt`. `--refresh` refetches and updates the library; `--no-library` skips
both library reads and writes. Without `--json`, the command prints Markdown and
source information.

`status` is `readable`, `partial`, or `unavailable`. Readable content has
`completeness: unverified`: extraction is not independent proof of full-text
completeness. Paid previews remain partial. Unavailable content exits 1 with a
JSON error and `article.diagnostics` on stderr, rather than returning an abstract
as the body. This uses the existing feed/export source, entitlement and cache
pipeline. `resolve-article` returns an ID; `review single` returns metadata and
does not guarantee a body.

### Public-account feeds and exports

Search first and verify the exact `MP_WXS_<digits>` ID before subscribing:

```bash
weread-omni search books "PUBLIC_ACCOUNT_NAME" --scope 2 --json
weread-omni public-accounts subscribe MP_WXS_1234567890 --json
weread-omni public-accounts articles MP_WXS_1234567890 --count 20 --json

weread-omni public-accounts feed MP_WXS_1234567890 --format json --out ./account.feed.json --limit 50 --json
weread-omni public-accounts feed subscriptions --format rss --out ./subscriptions.xml --limit 50 --json
weread-omni public-accounts export MP_WXS_1234567890 --out ./account-archive --limit 100 --json
```

Feeds and exports process 20 articles by default, with a maximum `--limit` of 100. They never overwrite an existing file or directory. Article bodies are fetched only from validated HTTPS `mp.weixin.qq.com/s` URLs. JavaScript challenges and CAPTCHAs are reported in diagnostics, not bypassed.

The protected-article endpoint is wired up, but the recorded live check returned `-2012`; it has not yet produced an article body. An error from `public-accounts paid-content` does not imply that the same account's other tokens have expired.

### Import a personal book

```bash
weread-omni import book ./my-book.epub --json
```

EPUB, PDF, MOBI, TXT, and AZW3 are supported. The default size limit is 200 MiB; override it with `WEREAD_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`.

## Local content library

The CLI stores book metadata, tables of contents, and downloaded public-account articles locally by default. A later request for the same content uses the local copy.

```bash
weread-omni library path --json
weread-omni library status --json
weread-omni library verify --json
```

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--refresh` | Fetch again and update the local copy |
| `--no-library` | Do not read or write the library for this invocation |

The default root is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/weread/library`, or `~/.local/share/weread/library` when `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset. Override it with `WEREAD_LIBRARY_DIR`. Indexes are account-scoped, identical payloads are stored once, and nothing is removed automatically.

The library contains unencrypted reading material, not credentials; treat it as sensitive data. It requires SQLite WAL support. If the filesystem cannot provide it, the CLI warns and continues without the library. Set `WEREAD_LIBRARY_ALLOW_UNSAFE=1` to bypass the check only when you are certain there is a single writer.

### Search scopes and paging

`search books --scope` accepts `0` everything, `10` ebooks (default), `16` web fiction, `14` audio, `6` authors, `12` full text, `13` booklists, `2` public accounts, and `4` articles.

| Command | Next page |
| --- | --- |
| `search books` | When `hasMore=1`, pass the last item's `searchIdx` to `--max-idx` |
| `shelf sync`, `public-accounts subscriptions` | Pass the returned `nextOffset` to `--offset` |
| `public-accounts articles` | Start without `--offset`, or pass a previous `synckey` as `--synckey` for a delta refresh; then page with each returned `nextOffset` |
| `notes notebooks` | Pass the last item's `sort` to `--last-sort` |
| `notes best`, `review list` | Increase `--max-idx` by the number of returned items |

`synckey` is an incremental-refresh cursor, not a page number. `book detail --count` defaults to 6 and accepts 1–12.

## TypeScript SDK

Log in through the CLI, then open the account with `AccountManager`:

```ts
import { AccountManager } from "weread-omni";

const account = await new AccountManager().open("default");
const weread = account.canonical;

const search = await weread.search.books("The Three-Body Problem");
const notes = await weread.notes.mine("BOOK_ID", { count: 20 });
```

The table lists operation entry points and omits shared request options. The package's TypeScript declarations are authoritative for exact signatures.

| Resource | Methods |
| --- | --- |
| `search` | `books(keyword, options?)`, `suggest(keyword, options?)` |
| `book` | `info(bookId)`, `detail(bookId, options?)`, `chapters(bookId)`, `progress(bookId)` |
| `shelf` | `sync()`, `add(bookId)`, `delete(bookId)`, `pin(bookId, top?)`, `setPrivate(bookId, secret?)`, `markFinished(bookId, finished?)`, `markReading(bookId, reading?)` |
| `publicAccounts` | `subscriptions(options?)`, `articles(accountId, options?)`, `resolveArticle(docUrl, options?)`, `paidContent(docUrl, options?)`, `subscribe(accountId)`, `unsubscribe(accountId)` |
| `notes` | `notebooks(options?)`, `recent(options?)`, `bookmarks(bookId, options?)`, `mine(bookId, options?)`, `best(bookId, options?)`, `readReviews(bookId, chapterUid, reviews, options?)`, `underlines(bookId, chapterUid, options?)`, `addBookmark(input)`, `updateBookmark(input)`, `removeBookmark(bookmarkId, options?)` |
| `review` | `list(bookId, options?)`, `single(reviewId, options?)`, `add(input)`, `edit(reviewId, content, options?)`, `delete(reviewId)` |
| `readData` | `detail(options?)` |
| `discover` | `recommend(options?)`, `similar(bookId, options?)` |
| `ai` | `askBook(input)`, `suggest(input)` |
| `import` | `book({ name, path })` or `book({ name, bytes })` |

The SDK is silent by default. Pass `logger: console` to a client for diagnostic logs. After token expiry, read requests and calls explicitly marked idempotent may be replayed once. Writes are never replayed automatically because the upstream service may already have applied them.

## Limits

- WeRead's private interfaces may change without notice. Risk controls, account permissions, and content entitlements also affect results.
- `-2041` means human verification is required. A headless client cannot complete that challenge; it is not token expiry.
- The project does not execute JavaScript challenges, solve CAPTCHAs, or impersonate browser fingerprints.
- Credentials and locally stored reading material are sensitive. See the [Security policy](SECURITY.md) for handling guidance and private vulnerability reporting.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test
npm run test:cov
npm run test:e2e
```

Unit and integration tests never contact WeRead. `test:e2e` packs the artifact and smoke-tests it as a consumer would install it.
